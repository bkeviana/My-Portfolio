<h1> My-Portfolio: Hire Me </h1> 
<p> In this repository, you will see that I created my very first made from scratch portfolio with only HTML and CSS languages. </p>
<p> Here's a liitle insight of my portfolio. </p>
<ul>
  <li> First, I created a responsive navbar, that turns into the hamburger icon on smaller devices. </li>
  <li> Second, I added a psudeo class  that allows the picture to enlarge once I hover my mouse over it. </li>
  <li> Thirdly, I created a grid that showcases all of my previous work, with the picture and link to the websites. </li>
  <li> Fourth, I ensured all my links worked, taking the user to it's corresponding parts. </li>
  <li> I've added buttons, such as "Hire Me" that redirects to my email. </li>
  <li> Fifth, I provided a picture, my name, my career and also a little section about me. </li>
  <li> Lastly, in the footer I referenced a Contact Me template (https://vidyasheela.com/component-category/Contact-Pages) space for any future recruiters to contact me with future job oppurtinities, along with a few social media platforms such as GitHub, LinkedIn, and Twitter. </li>
  <li> For an extra spark, I added a custom favicon to my website </li>
  </ul>
